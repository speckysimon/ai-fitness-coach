## üéØ The Gap

### **Current State:**
‚úÖ Race Day Predictor (pre-race)  
‚úÖ AI race plan generation  
‚úÖ Pacing strategy  
‚ùå **Post-race analysis** ‚Üê MISSING  
‚ùå **Learning from races** ‚Üê MISSING  
‚ùå **Historical comparison** ‚Üê MISSING  

### **The Problem:**
Athletes don't learn from races systematically. They rely on memory and gut feeling.

### **The Solution:**
Complete the race lifecycle: **Predict ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Learn ‚Üí Improve**

## üìä Example Analysis Output

```
üèÜ RACE ANALYSIS
Club Championship - Oct 15, 2025
2nd Place ‚Ä¢ 85km ‚Ä¢ 2:15:32

üìä PERFORMANCE SUMMARY
Overall Score: 85/100 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
‚Ä¢ Pacing: 70/100
‚Ä¢ Execution: 90/100
‚Ä¢ Tactics: 75/100

ü§ñ AI ASSESSMENT
Strong performance with 2nd place finish. Exceeded power 
targets but pacing needs refinement. Excellent climbing 
execution but faded in final 20km due to early intensity.

‚úÖ WHAT WENT WELL
‚Ä¢ Climb execution excellent - 270W vs 260W planned
‚Ä¢ Finished 4:28 faster than estimated
‚Ä¢ Good positioning throughout
‚Ä¢ Nutrition timing on point
‚Ä¢ Strong form translated to performance

‚ö†Ô∏è WHAT DIDN'T GO WELL
‚Ä¢ Started too aggressively - 15W over target
‚Ä¢ Faded in final 20km
‚Ä¢ Missed key breakaway at km 40
‚Ä¢ Spent 45min in Zone 4+ vs planned 30min
‚Ä¢ Normalized power 20W higher than planned

üí° KEY INSIGHTS
‚Ä¢ Climbing strength is major asset
‚Ä¢ Pacing discipline is limiting factor
‚Ä¢ Early intensity compromised late performance
‚Ä¢ Missing breakaway cost potential win

üéØ RECOMMENDATIONS
‚Ä¢ Start more conservatively - save 10-15W
‚Ä¢ Practice negative split pacing
‚Ä¢ Improve breakaway recognition
‚Ä¢ Add surge/recover intervals
‚Ä¢ Use power-based pacing alerts

üèãÔ∏è TRAINING FOCUS
‚Ä¢ Threshold endurance (90-95% FTP)
‚Ä¢ Race simulation with conservative starts
‚Ä¢ Tactical skills and positioning
```
