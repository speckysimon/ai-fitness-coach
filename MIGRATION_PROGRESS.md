## 📊 Migration Strategy

### Dual-Write Approach
1. Write to BOTH localStorage AND backend
2. Read from backend (with localStorage fallback)
3. After 2 weeks, remove localStorage writes
4. Keep localStorage as emergency backup

### User Experience
- ✅ Zero downtime
- ✅ Automatic migration on first load
- ✅ No data loss
- ✅ Rollback capability
