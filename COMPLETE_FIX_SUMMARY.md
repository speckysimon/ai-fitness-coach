## ⚠️ URGENT: Update Your .env File First!

**This is why nothing is working!**

### Step 1: Open your .env file

```bash
open /Users/simonosx/CascadeProjects/ai-fitness-coach/.env
```

Or manually open it in your editor.

### Step 2: Change these lines

**FROM:**
```env
PORT=5000
STRAVA_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5000/api/auth/strava/callback
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5000/api/google/callback
```

**TO:**
```env
PORT=5001
STRAVA_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5001/api/auth/strava/callback
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5001/api/google/callback
```

### Step 3: Restart the server

In your terminal where `npm run dev` is running:
1. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop
2. Run `npm run dev` again
3. Wait for both servers to start

### Step 4: Refresh your browser

Go to http://localhost:3000 and hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

## 🔧 Why Port 5001?

macOS Monterey and later use port 5000 for **AirPlay Receiver** (ControlCenter). Your backend server automatically switched to port 5001, but:

- Frontend was still trying to connect to port 5000
- All API calls were failing
- Result: Empty pages everywhere

**The fix:** Update `.env` to match the actual port (5001)

---

## 📋 All Fixes Applied

### 1. Port Configuration
- ✅ Updated `vite.config.js` to proxy to port 5001
- ✅ Updated `.env.example` to use port 5001
- ⚠️ **YOU MUST** update your `.env` file manually

### 2. All Activities Page
- ✅ Added token refresh logic
- ✅ Added 401/403 error handling
- ✅ Added token state management
- ✅ Added "No Strava" message
- ✅ Enhanced debug logging
- ✅ Refactored data processing

### 3. Form & Fitness Page
- ✅ Added token refresh logic
- ✅ Added 401/403 error handling
- ✅ Added token state management
- ✅ Enhanced debug logging
- ✅ Refactored data processing

### 4. Google Calendar OAuth
- ✅ Fixed redirect from `/setup` to `/settings`
- ✅ Added session validation
- ✅ Added CSRF protection
- ✅ Save tokens to database
- ✅ Use environment variable for frontend URL

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### After updating .env and restarting:

- [ ] **Login works** - No "Failed to connect to server" error
- [ ] **Dashboard loads** - Shows your activities
- [ ] **All Activities page** - Shows your activities list
- [ ] **Form & Fitness page** - Shows graphs with data
- [ ] **Settings page** - Can connect Strava/Google

### Check Browser Console

Open DevTools (F12) and check for:

**Good signs:**
```
AllActivities - Received activities: 45
Form - Received activities: 45
Form - Data processed successfully
```

**Bad signs:**
```
Failed to fetch
net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
404 Not Found
```

If you see bad signs, your `.env` file still has wrong port!

## 🎯 What Each Fix Does

### Port Fix (5000 → 5001)
**Problem:** Frontend trying to reach backend on wrong port  
**Solution:** Update all configs to use port 5001  
**Result:** Frontend can now reach backend ✅

### Token Refresh Logic
**Problem:** Expired tokens cause 401 errors, pages show no data  
**Solution:** Auto-refresh tokens before API calls, retry on 401/403  
**Result:** Pages work even with expired tokens ✅

### Google OAuth Fix
**Problem:** OAuth redirected to removed `/setup` page  
**Solution:** Redirect to `/settings`, save to database  
**Result:** Google Calendar connection works ✅

---

## 🚀 Quick Start After Fix

1. **Update .env file** (see Step 2 above)
2. **Restart server** (Ctrl+C, then `npm run dev`)
3. **Hard refresh browser** (Cmd+Shift+R)
4. **Test each page:**
   - Dashboard → Should show activities
   - All Activities → Should show list
   - Form & Fitness → Should show graphs
   - Settings → Should allow connections

---

## 🐛 If Still Not Working

### Check 1: Is server running on 5001?
```bash
lsof -i :5001
```
Should show `node` process.

### Check 2: Is .env updated?
```bash
cat .env | grep PORT
```
Should show `PORT=5001`.

### Check 3: Did you restart?
Server must be restarted after .env changes!

### Check 4: Browser console errors?
Open DevTools → Console tab  
Look for connection errors or 404s

### Check 5: Network tab
Open DevTools → Network tab  
Check if API calls go to port 5001
