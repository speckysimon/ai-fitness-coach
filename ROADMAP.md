### Priority 4: Data & Integration

16. **Scaling & Infrastructure** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL FOR GROWTH**
    - **Current Limitation**: 100-200 daily active users due to Strava API limits
    - **Phase 1 (Immediate - 2-3 hours)**: Database + Daily Sync
      - Add SQLite/PostgreSQL for activity storage
      - Implement daily background sync instead of real-time fetching
      - Serve data from database (reduces API calls by 80-90%)
      - **Result**: Support 500-800 users
    - **Phase 2 (Short-term - 1-2 hours)**: Production Deployment
      - Deploy to Railway/Render/Heroku
      - Set up automated daily sync jobs
      - Add monitoring and alerting
    - **Phase 3 (When 100+ users - 4-8 hours)**: Strava Webhooks
      - Implement webhook endpoint for real-time activity updates
      - Subscribe to Strava push notifications
      - Eliminate polling entirely
      - **Result**: Support 10,000+ users
    - **Phase 4 (When 100+ users - 1 hour)**: Apply for Strava Rate Limit Increase
      - Request higher API limits from Strava
      - Typical increases: 2-10x current limits
      - **Result**: Support 1,000-5,000 users (without webhooks)
