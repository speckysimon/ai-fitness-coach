   - ‚úÖ Full REST API endpoints for illness logging, adjustments, history
   - ‚úÖ AI analysis service with OpenAI integration (GPT-4o)
   - ‚úÖ Plan modification service created

2. **Frontend UI (100% Complete)**
   - ‚úÖ LogIllnessModal - Beautiful modal for logging illness/injury

## üêõ Current Issues to Fix

### Issue 1: Duplicate Illness Entries
**Problem:** User has 9 duplicate illness entries for the same period
**Impact:** Clutters database, confuses AI analysis
**Solution Started:** Added validation to LogIllnessModal to prevent duplicates
**Next Steps:**
- Add endpoint to delete old/duplicate illnesses
- Add UI to view and manage illness history
- Consider adding unique constraint on user_id + start_date

### Issue 2: Apply Adjustment Fails
**Problem:** When clicking "Apply Changes", get 500 error
**Error:** `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')`
**Root Cause:** Training plan structure doesn't match expected format (missing `sessions` array)
**Solution Started:** Added validation in planModificationService
**Next Steps:**
- Check actual training plan structure in localStorage
- Update planModificationService to handle actual plan format
- Test with real training plan data

### Issue 3: Pending Adjustments Not Showing
**Problem:** After creating adjustment, widget shows 0 pending adjustments
**Observed:** Adjustment IS created (ID: 2) but not appearing in widget
**Possible Causes:**
- Query filtering out the adjustment (user_accepted field?)
- Timing issue with widget refresh
- Database query issue
**Next Steps:**
- Check `/api/adaptation/adjustments/pending` endpoint
- Verify query filters in planAdjustmentDb.getPendingForUser()
- Add more logging to debug

### Issue 4: Date/Day Mismatch
**Problem:** Training plan shows "Monday Oct 9" but Oct 9, 2025 is Thursday
**Impact:** Confusing for users, incorrect calendar display
**Root Cause:** AI planner generating day names that don't match actual dates
**Next Steps:**
- Fix AI planner to calculate correct day names from dates
- Or remove day names entirely and only show dates

## üí° Notes

- User has FTP discrepancy: Dashboard shows 226W, FTP History shows 201W (separate issue)
- Training plan structure needs investigation - may not have `sessions` array
- Consider adding wellness check-in feature (optional, Phase 2)
- System is 75% complete and core functionality is working
- Main blocker is applying adjustments to training plan
