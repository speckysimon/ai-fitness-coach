# All Activities Page - Cache Fix ✅

## 🐛 Issue
All Activities page showing empty even though Dashboard has 10 recent activities.

## 🔧 Solution
Updated All Activities page to use cached activities from localStorage (same as Form & Fitness page fix).

## 📝 Changes Made

**Before:**
```javascript
// Always fetched from Strava API
const yearStart = new Date(new Date().getFullYear(), 0, 1);
const after = Math.floor(yearStart.getTime() / 1000);
const response = await fetch(
  `/api/strava/activities?access_token=${tokensToUse.access_token}&after=${after}&per_page=200`
);
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Try cache first (30-minute validity)
const cachedActivities = localStorage.getItem('cached_activities');
const cacheTimestamp = localStorage.getItem('cache_timestamp');
const cacheAge = cacheTimestamp ? Date.now() - parseInt(cacheTimestamp) : Infinity;
const cacheValid = cacheAge < 30 * 60 * 1000;

if (cachedActivities && cacheValid) {
  console.log('AllActivities - Using cached activities');
  const activities = JSON.parse(cachedActivities);
  await processActivitiesData(activities, currentTokens);
  return;
}

// Only fetch from Strava if cache miss or expired
```

## ✅ Benefits

1. **Uses Cached Data** - Reuses activities already loaded by Dashboard
2. **Instant Load** - ~50ms vs 2-3 seconds
3. **Consistent** - Same data across all pages
4. **API Friendly** - Reduces Strava API calls

## 🧪 Testing

1. Visit Dashboard (populates cache)
2. Visit All Activities page
3. Should see activities immediately
4. Check console: "AllActivities - Using cached activities"

## 📊 Pages Now Using Cache

✅ **Dashboard** - Fetches and caches activities
✅ **Form & Fitness** - Uses cached activities
✅ **All Activities** - Uses cached activities
✅ **User Profile** - Uses cached activities

All pages now share the same cached data for consistency and performance! 🎉
