## Why 20i Won't Work

Your RiderLabs app requires:

1. **Node.js Runtime**
   - 20i typically only supports PHP
   - Even if they support Node.js, it's limited

2. **Persistent Processes**
   - Your Express server needs to run 24/7
   - Shared hosting kills long-running processes

3. **SQLite Database**
   - 20i provides MySQL
   - Would require database migration

4. **WebSocket Support** (future)
   - Shared hosting doesn't support WebSockets
   - Needed for real-time features

5. **Build Process**
   - Need to run `npm run build`
   - FTP upload won't work for Node.js apps

## Alternative: Heroku (Easier but More Expensive)

If you want even easier deployment:

### Heroku
- **Pros**: 
  - Very easy deployment (git push)
  - Automatic SSL
  - Built-in PostgreSQL
  - No server management
  
- **Cons**:
  - More expensive (~$25-50/month)
  - Less control
  - Can be slow to wake up (free tier)

### Deployment Steps:
```bash
# Install Heroku CLI
brew install heroku

# Login
heroku login

# Create app
heroku create riderlabs

# Add PostgreSQL
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:mini

# Set environment variables
heroku config:set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
heroku config:set STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=your_id
# ... etc

# Deploy
git push heroku main
```

## Alternative: Vercel + Railway (Modern Stack)

### Vercel (Frontend) + Railway (Backend)

**Vercel** (Frontend only):
- Free tier available
- Automatic deployments
- Global CDN
- Perfect for React apps

**Railway** (Backend):
- $5/month
- Easy Node.js deployment
- Built-in PostgreSQL
- Simple environment variables

This splits your app but can be more cost-effective.
