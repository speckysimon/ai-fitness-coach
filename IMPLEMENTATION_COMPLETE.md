   ‚Üì
2. Marks activity as race in PostRaceAnalysis page
   ‚Üì
3. Submits 2-minute feedback form üìù
   ‚Üì
4. AI analyzes performance (GPT-4) ü§ñ
   - Performance Score: 85/100
   - Pacing Score: 70/100 ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Execution Score: 90/100
   - Tactical Score: 75/100
   ‚Üì
5. Analysis stored in localStorage
   - race_analyses[activityId] = { scores, insights, recommendations }
   ‚Üì
6. Athlete navigates to AI Coach (Plan Generator)
   ‚Üì
7. Purple "AI Will Use Your Race Data" card appears
   - Shows pacing score needs improvement
   - Highlights strengths to maintain

   ‚Üì
8. Athlete generates new training plan
   ‚Üì
9. PlanGenerator loads race history
   - Last 3 races loaded from localStorage

   ‚Üì
10. Race data sent to AI with plan request
    - raceHistory: [{ scores, insights, recommendations }]
    - trainingPriorities: { primary, weaknesses, strengths, pacingScore }
    ‚Üì
11. AI receives race context in prompt
    - "RECENT RACE PERFORMANCE: Pacing Score 70/100 ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS IMPROVEMENT"
    - "Areas Needing Improvement: Started too aggressively, Faded in final 20km"
    - "TRAINING PRIORITIES: Threshold endurance (90-95% FTP)"
    ‚Üì
12. AI generates customized plan

    - References race learnings in descriptions
    - Example: "Threshold Endurance Builder - Based on your recent race, 
               you faded in the final 20km. This session builds late-race 
               endurance at 90-95% FTP."
    ‚Üì
13. Plan includes coach note
    - "This plan has been customized based on your recent race analysis. 
       Key focus: Threshold endurance. We're addressing your pacing (70/100) 
       and building on your strength in Climbing."
    ‚Üì
14. Athlete trains with race-informed plan üí™
    ‚Üì
15. Next race: Improved pacing! üìà
    - Pacing Score: 85/100 ‚úÖ (was 70/100)
    ‚Üì
16. New analysis: "Pacing improved! Now focus on sprinting"
    ‚Üì
17. Next plan: Shifts focus to sprint training
    ‚Üì
18. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT LOOP üîÑ

## üìä **Data Flow**

### **localStorage Structure:**
```javascript
// race_analyses
{
  "12345678": {  // Strava activity ID
    "overallAssessment": "Strong performance with 2nd place...",
    "whatWentWell": ["Climb execution excellent", ...],

    "analyzedAt": "2025-10-21T20:00:00Z",
    "activityDate": "2025-10-15"
  }
}
```

### **API Request (Plan Generation):**
```javascript
POST /api/training/plan/generate
{
  activities: [...],
  goals: {...},
  constraints: {...},
  athleteMetrics: {...},
  
  // NEW: Race history integration
  raceHistory: [

  // NEW: Training priorities from latest race
  trainingPriorities: {
    primary: "Threshold endurance (90-95% FTP)",
    weaknesses: ["Started too aggressively", "Faded in final 20km", ...],
    strengths: ["Climb execution excellent", ...],
    pacingScore: 70
  }
}
```

### **AI Prompt (Excerpt):**
```
Create a 8-week training plan for an athlete preparing for a Gran Fondo event.

CRITICAL: The plan MUST contain EXACTLY 8 weeks. No more, no less.

RECENT RACE PERFORMANCE:
- Date: 2025-10-15
- Performance Score: 85/100
- Pacing Score: 70/100 ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
- Execution Score: 90/100
- Tactical Score: 75/100

KEY LEARNINGS FROM RACE:
Strengths Confirmed:
- Climb execution excellent - 270W vs 260W planned
- Finished 4:28 faster than estimated
- Good positioning throughout

Areas Needing Improvement:
- Started too aggressively - 15W over target
- Faded in final 20km
- Missed key breakaway at km 40

TRAINING PRIORITIES (from race analysis):
- Threshold endurance (90-95% FTP)
- Race simulation with conservative starts
- Tactical skills and positioning

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR PLAN DESIGN:
1. Design this training plan to specifically address the weaknesses identified
2. Include sessions that target the training focus areas above
3. Maintain and build on confirmed strengths
4. If pacing score was low (< 75), include race simulation sessions
5. Reference the race learnings in session descriptions

Example: "Threshold Endurance Builder - Based on your recent race, you faded 
in the final 20km. This session builds late-race endurance at 90-95% FTP."
