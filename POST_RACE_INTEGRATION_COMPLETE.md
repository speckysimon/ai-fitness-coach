## 📊 Data Flow Verification

### Frontend → Backend
```javascript
POST /api/training/plan/generate
{
  // ... other data ...
  raceHistory: [
    {
      date: "2024-10-20",
      performanceScore: 85,
      pacingScore: 72,
      executionScore: 88,
      tacticalScore: 80,
      whatWentWell: ["Strong finish", "Good positioning"],
      whatDidntGoWell: ["Started too fast", "Faded mid-race"],
      trainingFocus: ["Pacing discipline", "Endurance"],
      recommendations: [...]
    }
  ],
  trainingPriorities: {
    primary: "Pacing discipline",
    weaknesses: ["Started too fast", "Faded mid-race", ...],
    strengths: ["Strong finish", "Good positioning", ...],
    pacingScore: 72
  }
}
```

### AI Prompt Includes
```
RECENT RACE PERFORMANCE:
- Date: 2024-10-20
- Performance Score: 85/100
- Pacing Score: 72/100 ⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
- Execution Score: 88/100
- Tactical Score: 80/100

KEY LEARNINGS FROM RACE:
Strengths Confirmed:
- Strong finish
- Good positioning

Areas Needing Improvement:
- Started too fast
- Faded mid-race

TRAINING PRIORITIES (from race analysis):
- Pacing discipline
- Endurance

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR PLAN DESIGN:
1. Design this training plan to specifically address the weaknesses identified
2. Include sessions that target the training focus areas above
3. Maintain and build on confirmed strengths
4. Include race simulation sessions with conservative pacing practice
5. Reference the race learnings in session descriptions
```

### Generated Plan Output
```javascript
{
  weeks: [...],
  coachNotes: [
    {
      message: "This plan has been customized based on your recent race analysis. Key focus: Pacing discipline. We're addressing your pacing (72/100) and building on your strength in Strong finish.",
      timestamp: "2024-10-24T19:20:00.000Z",
      type: "Race Integration"
    }
  ]
}
```

- Standard session descriptions
- No race-specific coach notes

### With Race History
- ✅ Purple "AI Will Use Your Race Data" card appears
- ✅ Card shows pacing score, strengths, and focus
- ✅ Plan includes coach note about race integration
- ✅ Sessions reference race learnings (e.g., "Based on your recent race...")
- ✅ Training focuses on identified weaknesses
- ✅ Maintains identified strengths
- ✅ Includes race simulation if pacing < 75

---

## 💡 Example Session Descriptions

### Before Race Integration
```
"Threshold Intervals - 4x10min @ 95-100% FTP with 5min recovery"
```

### After Race Integration
```
"Threshold Endurance Builder - Based on your recent race where you faded in the final 20km, this session builds late-race endurance at 90-95% FTP. Focus on maintaining power in the final intervals."
```
