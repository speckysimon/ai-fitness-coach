# Weather Widget Implementation

**Date**: October 25, 2025, 7:34am
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
**Time**: ~45 minutes

---

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive weather widget using OpenWeather API (free tier) with multiple location options and training recommendations.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Compact Widget in Dashboard Header

**Location**: Dashboard top bar, next to DashboardClock

**Display**:
- Weather emoji (‚òÄÔ∏è ‚òÅÔ∏è üåßÔ∏è ‚ùÑÔ∏è etc.)
- Current temperature (large, bold)
- Weather condition description
- Location name with pin icon
- Settings button (change location)
- Refresh button

**Styling**:
- Gradient background (blue-to-cyan)
- Hover effects
- Dark mode support
- Responsive design

### 2. Hover Modal (Detailed Weather)

**Triggers**: Mouse hover over widget
**Stays Open**: While hovering over modal

**Content**:
- **Header**: Location name, description, emoji
- **Temperature**: Large display with "feels like"
- **Training Recommendation**: Color-coded card with advice
  - Perfect conditions (green): 15-25¬∞C, clear, low wind
  - Good conditions (blue): Generally favorable
  - Caution (yellow): Rain, strong winds
  - Warning (red): Extreme cold/heat
- **Weather Details Grid**:
  - Wind speed and direction (km/h, compass point)
  - Humidity percentage
  - Visibility (km)
  - Pressure (hPa)
- **Sunrise/Sunset**: Times with icons
- **Hourly Forecast**: Next 12 hours
  - Time, emoji, description
  - Precipitation probability
  - Temperature

### 3. Location Settings Modal

**Triggers**: Click settings button on widget

**Options**:

**A. Use Current Location**
- Button to request browser geolocation
- Auto-detects coordinates
- Saves as "Current Location"

**B. Search Location**
- Text input for city/location name
- Search button
- Geocoding via OpenWeather API
- Shows up to 5 results with:
  - Full display name (City, State, Country)
  - Coordinates
- Click to select and save

**C. Settings Page Integration**
- Location can also be set in Settings
- Persists across sessions

### 4. Weather Service (Backend Logic)

**File**: `src/lib/weatherService.js`

**Functions**:
- `getWeatherData(lat, lon)` - Fetch current + hourly forecast
- `getBrowserLocation()` - Request geolocation permission
- `geocodeLocation(name)` - Search for locations
- `getSavedLocation()` - Load from localStorage
- `saveLocation(location)` - Persist location
- `getWeatherEmoji(condition)` - Map conditions to emojis
- `getWindDirection(degrees)` - Convert to compass points
- `formatTime(timestamp)` - Format unix time
- `getTrainingRecommendation(weather)` - AI training advice

**Caching**:
- Weather data cached for 30 minutes
- Reduces API calls
- Stored in localStorage with timestamp
- Auto-refresh on expiry

### 5. Training Recommendations

**Logic**:
```javascript
- Very cold (<0¬∞C): "Consider indoor training" (warning)
- Very hot (>35¬∞C): "Train early/late, stay hydrated" (warning)
- Rain/High precipitation: "Indoor or wet weather gear" (caution)
- Strong winds (>40 km/h): "Adjust route accordingly" (caution)
- Perfect (15-25¬∞C, clear, <20 km/h wind): "Perfect conditions!" (perfect)
- Otherwise: "Good conditions for outdoor training" (good)
```

  source: "browser" | "search" | "default"
}
```

### Weather Data (cached)

## Technical Details

### Caching Strategy

**Why Cache?**
- Reduce API calls (stay within free tier)
- Faster load times
- Better user experience

**How It Works**:
1. Check localStorage for cached data
2. If found and <30 minutes old, use cache
3. Otherwise, fetch fresh data from API
4. Store in localStorage with timestamp

**Cache Key**: `weather_${lat}_${lon}`

### Error Handling

**Scenarios**:
1. **No API key**: Shows "Weather unavailable" with refresh button
2. **API error**: Shows error message with retry option
3. **Geolocation denied**: Falls back to default location
4. **Network error**: Uses cached data if available

**Fallback Location**: London (51.5074, -0.1278)

### Performance

**Initial Load**:
- ~500ms for API call
- Instant on subsequent loads (cache)

**Hover Modal**:
- Instant display (data already loaded)
- Smooth animations

**Location Search**:
- ~300ms for geocoding API
- Shows loading spinner

---

## Styling & Design

### Colors

**Light Mode**:
- Background: Blue-to-cyan gradient
- Text: Gray-900
- Cards: White with shadow

**Dark Mode**:
- Background: Blue-900/20 to cyan-900/20
- Text: White
- Cards: Gray-800 with border

### Animations

1. **Fade In**: Modal appears smoothly
2. **Hover Effects**: Widget scales slightly on hover
3. **Loading Spinners**: Rotating border animation
4. **Transitions**: 200ms ease-out for all changes

### Responsive Design

- Desktop: Full widget with all details
- Tablet: Slightly smaller, still fully functional
- Mobile: Compact but readable (future enhancement)
