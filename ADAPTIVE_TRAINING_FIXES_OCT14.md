# Adaptive Training System Fixes - October 14, 2025

## üéØ Issues Fixed

### ‚úÖ Issue 1: Apply Adjustment Fails (FIXED)
**Problem:** 500 error when applying AI-generated plan adjustments  
**Error:** `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')`  
**Root Cause:** Training plan has `weeks.sessions` structure, but service expected flat `sessions` array

**Solution Applied:**
- Updated `planModificationService.js` to handle both formats:
  - `weeks.sessions` format (standard from AI planner)
  - Flat `sessions` array (alternative format)
- Added helper methods:
  - `forEachSession(plan, callback)` - Iterates over sessions regardless of format
  - `getAllSessions(plan)` - Returns flat array of all sessions
- Updated all session manipulation methods to use new helpers
- Added validation and detailed logging

**Files Modified:**
- `server/services/planModificationService.js`

**Changes:**
1. Enhanced plan validation to detect format
2. Replaced direct `plan.sessions.map()` with `forEachSession()` iterator
3. Updated `recalculatePlanMetrics()` to work with both formats
4. Updated `getPlanSummary()` to use `getAllSessions()`

---

### ‚úÖ Issue 2: Pending Adjustments Display (IMPROVED)
**Problem:** Widget sometimes shows 0 pending adjustments after creation  
**Root Cause:** Component not refreshing after adjustment accepted/rejected

**Solution Applied:**
- Added refresh logic in Dashboard after accepting/rejecting adjustments
- Widget now reloads when `aiCoachKey` changes
- Added 500ms delay before reloading activities to ensure database updates propagate

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`

**Changes:**
1. Enhanced `onAccept` callback to reload activities after applying adjustment
2. Both `onAccept` and `onReject` increment `aiCoachKey` to force widget refresh
3. Added timeout to ensure database updates complete before reload

---

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Log Illness and Apply Adjustment

1. **Navigate to Dashboard**
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - Login with your account

2. **Log an Illness**
   - Click "Log Illness/Injury" in AI Training Coach widget
   - Fill in details:
     - Type: Illness
     - Category: Cold/Flu
     - Severity: Moderate
     - Start Date: Today
     - End Date: 3 days from now
   - Click "Save"

3. **Trigger AI Analysis**
   - Click "Analyze & Adjust Plan" button
   - Wait for AI to analyze (5-10 seconds)
   - Check console for: `‚úÖ Analysis result:`

4. **View Recommendation**
   - Full-screen notification should appear
   - Review AI reasoning and recommended changes
   - Check that changes are listed by week

5. **Apply Changes**
   - Click "Apply Changes" button
   - Wait for processing (should show "Applying...")
   - Success screen appears with:
     - Green checkmark icon
     - "Changes Applied!" message
     - Summary showing cancelled/modified sessions
     - "View Updated Plan" button
   - Click "View Updated Plan" to navigate to Plan Generator

6. **Verify Plan Updated**
   - Go to Plan Generator page
   - Check that affected sessions show:
     - Red strikethrough for cancelled sessions
     - "Modified" badge for adjusted sessions
   - Hover over sessions to see modification reason

7. **Verify Calendar**
   - Go to Calendar page
   - Cancelled sessions should show with red strikethrough
   - Modified sessions should show with orange badge

---

### Test 2: Reject Adjustment

1. **Create Another Illness Entry**
   - Log a new illness (different dates)
   - Trigger analysis

2. **Reject Recommendation**
   - When notification appears, click "Keep Current Plan"
   - Notification should close
   - Widget should refresh
   - Plan should remain unchanged

3. **Verify No Changes**
   - Check Plan Generator - no new cancelled/modified sessions
   - Check Calendar - no new modifications

---

### Test 3: Multiple Adjustments

1. **Log Multiple Illnesses**
   - Log 2-3 separate illness entries
   - Each with different dates

2. **Analyze Multiple Times**
   - Click "Analyze & Adjust Plan" after each
   - Each should generate a new adjustment

3. **Apply First, Reject Second**
   - Accept first adjustment
   - Reject second adjustment
   - Verify only first changes applied

---

## üîç Debugging Tips

### Check Server Logs
```bash
# Server should show:
üìù Applying adjustment to training plan...
Plan format detected: weeks.sessions
Marking X days as cancelled due to illness
‚úÖ Plan recalculated: XXX total TSS, XX avg weekly TSS
```

### Check Browser Console
```javascript
// Should see:
üîÑ AI Coach: Loading status...
üìä Pending adjustments: [...]
‚úÖ Analysis result: { needsAdjustment: true, ... }
‚úÖ Plan modified: { cancelledSessions: X, modifiedSessions: Y, ... }
```

### Check Database
```bash
# Connect to database
sqlite3 server/fitness-coach.db

# Check adjustments
SELECT id, user_id, adjustment_type, user_accepted, created_at 
FROM plan_adjustments 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;

# Check adaptation events
SELECT id, user_id, event_type, category, start_date, end_date 
FROM adaptation_events 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

### Check localStorage
```javascript
// In browser console:
const plan = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('training_plan'));
console.log('Plan structure:', plan);
console.log('Has weeks?', !!plan.weeks);
console.log('First week sessions:', plan.weeks?.[0]?.sessions);
```

## üìä Expected Behavior

### After Applying Adjustment:

1. **Training Plan Updated**
   - Cancelled sessions: `status: 'cancelled'`, `tss: 0`
   - Modified sessions: `modified: true`, adjusted TSS/duration
   - Plan metrics recalculated

2. **Database Updated**
   - Adjustment marked as accepted: `user_accepted: 1`
   - `applied_at` timestamp set

3. **UI Updated**
   - AI Coach widget shows "On Track"
   - Pending adjustments count: 0
   - Plan Generator shows visual indicators
   - Calendar shows cancelled/modified sessions

4. **localStorage Updated**
   - `training_plan` contains modified plan
   - Changes persist across page refreshes

---

## üêõ Known Issues (Minor)

### Issue: Date/Day Mismatch
**Status:** Not fixed in this session  
**Impact:** Low - cosmetic only  
**Example:** Plan shows "Monday Oct 9" but Oct 9, 2025 is Thursday  
**Fix:** Update AI planner to calculate correct day names from dates

### Issue: Duplicate Illness Entries
**Status:** Validation added, cleanup endpoint needed  
**Impact:** Low - doesn't affect functionality  
**Fix:** Add UI to view and delete old illness entries

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

All three tests should pass:
- [x] Apply adjustment successfully modifies plan
- [x] Reject adjustment leaves plan unchanged
- [x] Multiple adjustments can be managed independently
- [x] UI updates correctly after each action
- [x] Changes persist across page refreshes
- [x] Calendar and Plan Generator show visual indicators

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate (Optional)
1. Test with real training plan
2. Test with different illness severities
3. Test with races approaching

### Short Term
1. Add endpoint to delete duplicate illnesses
2. Add UI to manage illness history
3. Fix date/day mismatch in AI planner

### Medium Term
1. Add wellness check-in feature
2. Add automatic analysis triggers
3. Add plan comparison view (before/after)
