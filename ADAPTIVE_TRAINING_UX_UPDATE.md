# Adaptive Training UX Improvements - October 14, 2025

## 🎨 User Experience Enhancement

### Problem
After clicking "Apply Changes" on the training plan adjustment modal, users had no feedback about:
- Whether the changes were actually applied
- What specific changes were made
- How to view the updated plan

### Solution
Added a **success confirmation screen** with clear feedback and navigation.
