2. Exports to bike computer formats (.FIT, .ERG, .ZWO)
3. Provides post-race analysis comparing plan vs reality
4. Creates a continuous improvement loop

### What We're NOT Building (Yet)

- ‚ùå Live GPS tracking during race
- ‚ùå Real-time plan adjustments
- ‚ùå Mobile app with audio cues
- ‚ùå Bike computer native apps
- ‚ùå Smartwatch integration

## üéØ Core Features

### Feature 1: Enhanced Race Plan Generation

**Current State:**
- AI generates text-based race plan
- General pacing advice
- No structured segments

**Enhanced Version:**
- **Segment-based breakdown** of entire race
- Each segment includes:
  - Distance range (km X-Y)
  - Duration estimate
  - Terrain type (flat, climb, descent, rolling)
  - Power target (watts)
  - Heart rate zone
  - Cadence recommendation
  - Pacing strategy ("Start easy, finish strong")
  - Nutrition cues ("Eat gel at km 20")
  - Tactical notes

**Example Output:**
```
Segment 1: Km 0-15 (Flat Approach)
- Duration: 22-24 minutes
- Terrain: Flat, slight tailwind
- Power Target: 220W (72% FTP) - Zone 2
- HR Zone: 2 (140-155 bpm)
- Cadence: 85-95 rpm
- Strategy: Start conservative, find your rhythm
- Nutrition: Sip water every 5 minutes
- Notes: Stay in the pack, don't chase early attacks

Segment 2: Km 15-23 (Main Climb)
- Duration: 28-32 minutes
- Terrain: 8km climb, 6% average, max 12%
- Power Target: 240W (80% FTP) - Zone 3
- HR Zone: 3 (155-165 bpm)
- Cadence: 70-80 rpm (lower on steep sections)
- Strategy: Steady effort, don't surge
- Nutrition: Gel at km 20
- Notes: This is the decisive climb, pace yourself
```

3. System detects race completion
4. AI analyzes: Planned vs Actual

**Analysis Includes:**

#### Segment-by-Segment Comparison
- Planned power vs Actual power
- Planned time vs Actual time
- Deviation analysis
- Energy expenditure comparison

#### Performance Insights
- "You went 15W too hard on Climb 2 - this cost you 2 minutes in the final"
- "Perfect pacing on the descent - well executed"
- "Faded in final 10km - possible nutrition issue?"
- "Started too conservatively - had 20W left at finish"

#### Learning Points
- What worked well
- What to adjust next time
- Rider profile updates
- FTP validation/adjustment

#### Visual Comparison

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: File Format Compatibility
- **Risk:** Generated files don't work on all devices
- **Mitigation:** Test with multiple bike computers, provide fallback PDF

### Risk 2: AI Plan Quality
- **Risk:** Generated segments don't make sense
- **Mitigation:** Manual review option, user feedback loop

### Risk 3: Strava API Limits
- **Risk:** Can't fetch activity data for analysis
- **Mitigation:** Already have activity data from sync, use cached data

### Risk 4: User Adoption
- **Risk:** Users don't understand how to use exported files
- **Mitigation:** Clear documentation, video tutorials, step-by-step guides
