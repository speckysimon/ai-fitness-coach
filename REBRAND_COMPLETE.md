## 📝 Remaining Tasks (Optional - Low Priority)

These files still reference "AI Fitness Coach" but are rarely seen by users:

1. **src/pages/TermsOfService.jsx** (8 references)
2. **src/pages/PrivacyPolicy.jsx** (1 reference)
3. **src/pages/Methodology.jsx** (1 reference)
4. **src/pages/QuickRunPage.jsx** (1 reference)
5. **src/pages/Setup.jsx** (1 reference)
6. Various markdown docs (COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md, etc.)

**Recommendation:** Update these gradually as you have time. They're not critical for launch.
