# Scope Guard - Avoiding Feature Creep

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Purpose:** Quick reference to stay focused on core mission

---

## 🎯 **Our Core Mission (TL;DR)**

**Empower cyclists to achieve peak performance through AI-powered training intelligence and team collaboration.**

---

## ✅ **IN SCOPE - Build These**

### **Phase 1: Individual Excellence** (Current Focus)
- ✅ AI training plan generation
- ✅ Race day preparation (GPX analysis)
- ✅ Activity matching and tracking
- ✅ Performance analytics (FTP, FTHR, rider type)
- ✅ Adaptive planning (adjust plans based on reality)
- ✅ HR/Power zone training
- ⏳ Form predictor (CTL/ATL/TSB)

### **Phase 2: Team Collaboration** (Next Priority)
- ⏳ Club race strategy planning
- ⏳ Team role assignment (sprinter, climber, domestique)
- ⏳ Coordinated race tactics
- ⏳ Post-race team analysis

---

## ❌ **OUT OF SCOPE - Don't Build These (Yet)**

### **Not Now:**
- ❌ Social features (likes, comments, feeds)
- ❌ Marketplace or e-commerce
- ❌ Video content or tutorials
- ❌ Nutrition tracking (beyond basic integration)
- ❌ Sleep tracking
- ❌ Multi-sport (running, swimming, triathlon)
- ❌ Real-time race execution (live guidance)
- ❌ Injury prediction/prevention AI
- ❌ Custom workout builder (use AI instead)
- ❌ Community challenges or competitions
- ❌ Leaderboards or rankings
- ❌ Badges or gamification
- ❌ Chat or messaging
- ❌ Calendar integration (Google, Outlook)
- ❌ Weather API integration (nice-to-have, not core)
- ❌ Advanced data visualization (keep it simple)

### **Maybe Later (Phase 3+):**
- 🔮 Coach mode for team managers
- 🔮 Predictive performance modeling
- 🔮 Nutrition optimization
- 🔮 Recovery optimization
- 🔮 Integration marketplace
- 🔮 White-label for coaches

## 🎯 **Decision Framework**

### **Before Adding Any Feature, Ask:**

1. **Does it directly help cyclists achieve their goals?**
   - If no → Don't build it

2. **Does it support team race strategy?**
   - If no → Deprioritize

3. **Can AI do it better than manual input?**
   - If yes → Use AI, don't build manual UI

4. **Is it core to our unique value prop?**
   - If no → Probably not worth it

5. **Would a professional coach do this?**
   - If no → Question if we should

6. **Does it require significant maintenance?**
   - If yes → Better have strong justification

## 🚫 **Common Scope Creep Traps**

### **Trap 1: "Users Might Want..."**
- **Reality:** Users want results, not features
- **Solution:** Focus on outcomes, not feature lists

### **Trap 2: "Competitor X Has..."**
- **Reality:** We're not trying to be Strava or TrainingPeaks
- **Solution:** Double down on our unique strengths (AI + Team)

### **Trap 3: "It Would Be Cool If..."**
- **Reality:** Cool ≠ Valuable
- **Solution:** Validate with real user problems first

### **Trap 4: "It's Just a Small Feature..."**
- **Reality:** No feature is small (maintenance, bugs, complexity)
- **Solution:** Every feature must earn its place

### **Trap 5: "We Need More Data..."**
- **Reality:** We have Strava data, that's enough for now
- **Solution:** Perfect is the enemy of good

---

## 🚨 **Red Flags - Stop and Reassess**

If you find yourself saying:
- "Let's add a social feed..."
- "We should build our own activity tracker..."
- "What if we added gamification..."
- "Users might want to share on Instagram..."
- "We need a mobile app..."
- "Let's build a workout library..."
- "We should add nutrition tracking..."

**STOP. Review this document. Refocus on core mission.**

## 💡 **The North Star**

### **Every Feature Should Answer:**

**"Does this help cyclists achieve their goals faster through AI-powered intelligence?"**

If the answer is not a clear **YES**, don't build it.

## 🎯 **Measuring Success**

### **We're Successful When:**
- ✅ Training plan completion rate >70%
- ✅ Race performance improvement >10%
- ✅ User satisfaction >4.5/5 stars
- ✅ Team win rate improvement >20%

### **NOT When:**
- ❌ We have the most features
- ❌ We look like Strava
- ❌ We have the prettiest UI
- ❌ We have the most integrations

## 💪 **Stay Strong**

**Remember:**

- Professional-level intelligence for amateur cyclists

**That's it. That's the mission.**

## 🎯 **When In Doubt**

Ask yourself:

**"Would this help my cycling club win our next race?"**

If yes → Consider it  
If no → Skip it

**Stay focused. Build what matters. Win races.** 🏆
