# AI Workout Analysis Feature

Comprehensive AI-powered analysis that evaluates both workout quality and plan alignment.

---

## üéØ Overview

The AI Workout Analysis feature provides athletes with detailed feedback on their completed workouts, going beyond simple plan compliance to evaluate overall workout quality, execution, and training adaptations.

---

## ‚ú® Features

### 1. **Comprehensive Analysis**

The AI provides a 4-6 sentence analysis covering:

- **Workout Quality Assessment** - Evaluates power/HR numbers, highlights strong points
- **Plan Alignment** - How well the workout matched the planned session
- **Training Type Identification** - What type of training was actually performed
- **Adaptation & Recommendations** - Whether adjustments are needed

### 2. **Workout Quality Rating**

Each workout receives a quality rating:

- üåü **Excellent** - Outstanding performance, hitting all targets
- üí™ **Good** - Solid workout, good execution
- üëç **Fair** - Acceptable performance, room for improvement
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs Attention** - Concerning performance, may need recovery or plan adjustment

### 3. **Deviation Level**

Tracks how closely the workout matched the plan:

- ‚úì **Low** - Good alignment with plan
- ‚ö° **Medium** - Moderate deviation from plan
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **High** - Significant deviation from plan

### 4. **Smart Recommendations**

- Suggests plan updates when deviation indicates systematic changes needed
- Acknowledges when a workout was good quality despite deviating from plan
- Provides specific, actionable feedback

## üîß How It Works

### User Flow

1. **Complete a workout** on Strava
2. **Wait for auto-matching** (a few minutes for Strava sync)
3. **Click "View Match"** on the matched session
4. **Add optional notes** about how the workout felt
5. **Click "AI Coach Analysis"** button
6. **Review comprehensive feedback** with quality rating and recommendations

### Data Analyzed

The AI considers:

- **Planned Session**: Type, duration, targets, description
- **Actual Activity**: 
  - Duration and distance
  - Average and normalized power
  - Max power output
  - Average and max heart rate
  - Training Stress Score (TSS)
  - Elevation gain
- **Athlete Feedback**: Optional comments about how the workout felt

## üí° Example Analysis

### Scenario: Endurance Ride ‚Üí Threshold Workout

**Planned**: 90-minute Zone 2 endurance ride
**Actual**: 75-minute ride with 220W avg, 280W NP, 165 bpm avg

**AI Analysis**:
> "You hit excellent power numbers with a normalized power of 280W, showing strong sustained effort throughout the 75-minute ride. Your average heart rate of 165 bpm indicates you were working at a solid threshold intensity. Despite the deviation from the planned endurance ride, this was a strong workout targeted more at threshold power development rather than the planned Zone 2 aerobic base. The 15-minute shorter duration is acceptable given the higher intensity. This suggests you're feeling strong and may benefit from incorporating more threshold work into your plan."

**Quality**: üí™ Good Workout
**Deviation**: ‚ö° Moderate deviation from plan
**Recommendation**: Consider plan adjustment

## üé® UI Components

### Workout Quality Badge

Displayed prominently at the top of the analysis:

```jsx
üåü Excellent Workout  // Green background
üí™ Good Workout       // Blue background
üëç Fair Workout       // Yellow background
‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Attention    // Red background
```

### Deviation Indicator

Shows plan alignment below the analysis:

```jsx
‚úì Good alignment with plan        // Green
‚ö° Moderate deviation from plan    // Yellow
‚ö†Ô∏è Significant deviation from plan // Red
```

### Plan Update Suggestion

Appears when AI recommends adjusting the plan:

```jsx
üí° Recommendation: Consider using the "Adjust Plan" feature 
   to update your training plan based on this workout.
```
