## 🎯 **Brand Strategy Discussion**

### Domain Research
- ✅ **riderlabs.io** - Available and purchased!
- ❌ **riderlabs.com** - Taken (Etsy motorbike shop, different industry)
- 💰 **riderlab.com** - Available but €3,169.79 (PASS!)
- ✅ **Decision:** Use .io as primary domain (perfect for tech)

### Why RiderLabs Works
1. **Cycling-relevant** - "Rider" is clear
2. **Tech-forward** - "Labs" = innovation, data science
3. **Not limiting** - Works for all cycling, could expand
4. **Clean availability** - No major conflicts
5. **Professional** - Scalable brand
6. **Domain perfect** - .io is ideal for tech products

### Alternatives Considered
- ❌ **RiderLabz** - Unprofessional, gimmicky, hard to spell
- ✅ **RiderLabs** - Clean, professional, memorable
