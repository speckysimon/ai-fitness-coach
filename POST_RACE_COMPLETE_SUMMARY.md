## 💡 Example Race Analysis Output

```
🏆 RACE ANALYSIS
Club Championship - Oct 15, 2025
2nd Place • 85km • 2:15:32

📊 PERFORMANCE SUMMARY
Overall Score: 85/100 ⭐⭐⭐⭐
• Pacing: 70/100 ⚠️
• Execution: 90/100 ✅
• Tactical: 75/100

🤖 AI COACH ASSESSMENT
Strong performance with 2nd place finish. Exceeded power 
targets but pacing needs refinement. Excellent climbing 
execution but faded in final 20km due to early intensity.

✅ WHAT WENT WELL
• Climb execution excellent - 270W vs 260W planned
• Finished 4:28 faster than estimated
• Good positioning throughout
• Nutrition timing on point
• Strong form translated to performance

⚠️ WHAT DIDN'T GO WELL
• Started too aggressively - 15W over target
• Faded in final 20km
• Missed key breakaway at km 40
• Spent 45min in Zone 4+ vs planned 30min
• Normalized power 20W higher than planned

💡 KEY INSIGHTS
• Climbing strength is major asset
• Pacing discipline is limiting factor
• Early intensity compromised late performance

🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT RACE
• Start more conservatively - save 10-15W
• Practice negative split pacing
• Improve breakaway recognition
• Add surge/recover intervals
• Use power-based pacing alerts

🏋️ TRAINING FOCUS
• Threshold endurance (90-95% FTP)
• Race simulation with conservative starts
• Tactical skills and positioning
```
