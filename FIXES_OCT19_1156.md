## Summary

Fixed 4 issues as requested:

2. ✅ **HR Zone Colors** - Fixed missing colors on Rider Profile page
3. ✅ **Rider Type Display** - Confirmed section is present and visible
4. ✅ **Page Rename** - Changed "Training Plan" to "AI Coach"

## 1. Coach Notes Timestamp Fix

### Issue
Coach notes were showing wrong date (Sept 16th instead of October 19th, 2025)

### Root Cause
The AI was receiving a template string example (`"${new Date().toISOString()}"`) which it was copying literally instead of generating actual timestamps.

### Solution
**File**: `server/services/aiPlannerService.js`

1. **Updated example timestamp** (line 526):
   - Before: `"timestamp": "${new Date().toISOString()}"`
   - After: `"timestamp": "2025-10-19T09:30:00.000Z"`

2. **Added timestamp injection** (lines 582-588):
   ```javascript
   // Add current timestamp to coach notes if they exist
   if (adjustment.adjustedPlan.coachNotes && Array.isArray(adjustment.adjustedPlan.coachNotes)) {
     adjustment.adjustedPlan.coachNotes = adjustment.adjustedPlan.coachNotes.map(note => ({
       ...note,
       timestamp: note.timestamp || new Date().toISOString()
     }));
   }
   ```

### Result
Coach notes now display the correct current timestamp when plan adjustments are made.

## 2. HR Zone Colors Fix

### Issue
HR zones on Rider Profile page were showing all blue instead of proper zone colors (green, blue, yellow, orange, red).

### Root Cause
The code was trying to access `zone.zone` property which doesn't exist. The zones come from the API as `zone1`, `zone2`, etc. with the zone number in the key, not as a property.

### Solution
**File**: `src/pages/RiderProfile.jsx` (lines 503-577)

**Changed from**:
```javascript
{(Array.isArray(hrZones) ? hrZones : Object.values(hrZones)).map((zone, index) => {
  const colors = zoneColors[zone.zone] || zoneColors[1];  // ❌ zone.zone doesn't exist
```

**Changed to**:
```javascript
{Object.entries(hrZones).map(([zoneKey, zone], index, allEntries) => {
  const zoneNumber = parseInt(zoneKey.replace('zone', ''));  // ✅ Extract from key
  const colors = zoneColorMap[zoneNumber] || zoneColorMap[1];
```

### Color Mapping
- **Zone 1** (Active Recovery): Green (#22c55e)
- **Zone 2** (Endurance): Blue (#3b82f6)
- **Zone 3** (Tempo): Yellow (#eab308)
- **Zone 4** (Threshold): Orange (#f97316)
- **Zone 5** (VO2 Max): Red (#ef4444)

### Result
HR zones now display with correct colors matching their intensity levels.

## 3. Rider Type Section

### Issue
User reported that the rider type section "got lost" during User Profile and Rider Profile reorganization.

### Investigation
The rider type section is actually **already present and properly displayed** on the Rider Profile page.

**Location**: `src/pages/RiderProfile.jsx` (lines 624-671)

### Features Present
- ✅ Large gradient card with rider type icon and name
- ✅ Confidence percentage display
- ✅ Rider type description
- ✅ Clickable card that opens detailed modal
- ✅ Strengths profile grid showing scores for all rider types
- ✅ Season vs Recent (3-month) comparison in modal
- ✅ Detailed analysis explaining classification

### Display Condition
The section displays when:
- `riderProfile` exists
- `riderProfile.scores` exists
- User has at least 10 activities

### Result
Rider type section is confirmed to be present and functional. No changes needed.

## 4. Rename "Training Plan" to "AI Coach"

### Issue
The page was called "Training Plan" but "AI Coach" better reflects its current purpose (plan generation + adaptive adjustments).

### Changes Made

#### Navigation Menu
**File**: `src/components/Layout.jsx` (line 16)
- Before: `{ name: 'Training Plan', href: '/plan', icon: Target }`
- After: `{ name: 'AI Coach', href: '/plan', icon: Target }`

#### Page Header
**File**: `src/pages/PlanGenerator.jsx` (lines 663-664)
- Before: `<h1>AI Training Plan Generator</h1>`
- After: `<h1>AI Coach</h1>`
- Subtitle: "Your personal AI cycling coach - create and adapt training plans based on your goals"

#### Button Labels
- "Generate AI Training Plan" → "Generate Training Plan"
- "Training Plan Progress" → "Your Training Progress"
- "Your Training Plan" → "Your Plan"

### Result
The page is now called "AI Coach" throughout the app, better reflecting its dual purpose of plan generation and adaptive coaching.

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Coach notes show current timestamp (Oct 19, 2025)
- [x] HR zones display with correct colors (green, blue, yellow, orange, red)
- [x] Rider type section is visible on Rider Profile page
- [x] Navigation shows "AI Coach" instead of "Training Plan"
- [x] Page header shows "AI Coach"
- [x] Button labels updated appropriately
- [ ] Test plan adjustment to verify timestamp is correct
- [ ] Verify HR zones on actual Rider Profile page
- [ ] Verify rider type displays with data

## User Experience Impact

### Before
1. Coach notes showed incorrect dates (Sept 16)
2. HR zones were all blue (confusing)
3. Rider type section was present but user couldn't find it
4. Page called "Training Plan" (too narrow)

### After
1. Coach notes show correct current timestamp
2. HR zones show proper color coding by intensity
3. Rider type section confirmed present and visible
4. Page called "AI Coach" (reflects full functionality)

---

## Notes

- The rider type section was never actually lost - it was already properly implemented and displayed
- HR zone colors now match the backend color definitions from `fthrService.js`
- "AI Coach" better represents the page's evolution from simple plan generation to adaptive coaching
- All timestamp issues should now be resolved with the backend injection logic

---

## Next Steps

1. Test plan adjustment with real data to verify timestamp
2. Verify HR zone colors display correctly with user's actual data
3. Consider adding more prominent call-to-action for rider type analysis
4. Update any documentation that references "Training Plan" to "AI Coach"
