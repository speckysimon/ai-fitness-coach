# Race Tags Persistence Fix

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Issue:** Race tags lost when reconnecting Strava  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

---

## üêõ Problem

Race tags were stored in browser `localStorage`, which meant:
- Tags were lost when reconnecting Strava
- Tags were lost when clearing browser data
- Tags were not synced across devices
- Had to manually retag all races after reconnection

---

## ‚úÖ Solution

Moved race tags from `localStorage` to the **backend database** so they persist permanently.

---

## üîß Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema (`server/db.js`)

Added new `race_tags` table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS race_tags (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  activity_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_race INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE(user_id, activity_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

Added database operations:
- `raceTagDb.setRaceTag(userId, activityId, isRace)` - Set/unset race tag
- `raceTagDb.getAllForUser(userId)` - Get all race tags for user
- `raceTagDb.isRace(userId, activityId)` - Check if activity is a race
- `raceTagDb.deleteAllForUser(userId)` - Delete all race tags for user

### 2. API Endpoints (`server/routes/raceTags.js`)

Created new endpoints:
- `GET /api/race-tags` - Fetch all race tags for current user
- `POST /api/race-tags` - Set/unset a single race tag
- `POST /api/race-tags/bulk` - Bulk update race tags

All endpoints require authentication via session token.

### 3. Server Routes (`server/index.js`)

Added race tags route:
```javascript
import raceTagRoutes from './routes/raceTags.js';
app.use('/api/race-tags', raceTagRoutes);
```

### 4. Frontend Utilities (`src/lib/raceUtils.js`)

Replaced localStorage functions with API calls:
- `fetchRaceTags()` - Fetch from backend
- `setActivityRace(activityId, isRace)` - Save to backend
- `saveRaceTagsBulk(raceTags)` - Bulk save to backend

### 5. Edit Activity Modal (`src/components/EditActivityModal.jsx`)

Updated to use backend API:
- Load race tag from backend on mount
- Save race tag to backend on save
- Show error if save fails

### 6. Dashboard (`src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`)

Updated to fetch race tags from backend:
- Load race tags via API when activities load
- Reload race tags after editing activity

### 7. All Activities (`src/pages/AllActivities.jsx`)

Updated to fetch race tags from backend:
- Load race tags via API on component mount
- Reload race tags after editing activity

### 8. Race Analytics (`src/pages/RaceAnalytics.jsx`)

Updated to fetch race tags from backend:
- Load race tags via API before fetching race data

### 9. Calendar (`src/pages/Calendar.jsx`)

Updated to fetch race tags from backend:
- Load race tags via API when activities load

## üéØ How It Works Now

### Tagging a Race

1. User clicks edit icon on activity
2. Toggles "Mark as Race" switch
3. Clicks "Save Changes"
4. Frontend calls `POST /api/race-tags` with activity ID
5. Backend saves to `race_tags` table
6. Race tag persists in database ‚úÖ

### Loading Race Tags

1. Page loads and fetches activities
2. Frontend calls `GET /api/race-tags`
3. Backend queries `race_tags` table for user
4. Returns object: `{ "12345": true, "67890": true }`
5. Frontend displays race icons on tagged activities

### Reconnecting Strava

1. User disconnects and reconnects Strava
2. New Strava tokens are saved
3. Activities are refetched
4. Race tags are loaded from database
5. **All race tags are still there!** ‚úÖ

---

## üß™ Testing

### Test 1: Tag a Race
1. Go to All Activities or Dashboard
2. Click edit icon on an activity
3. Toggle "Mark as Race"
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. ‚úÖ Activity shows race trophy icon

### Test 2: Reconnect Strava
1. Go to Settings
2. Disconnect Strava
3. Reconnect Strava
4. Go back to All Activities
5. ‚úÖ Race tags are still there!

### Test 3: Check Database
```bash
cd /Users/simonosx/CascadeProjects/ai-fitness-coach/server
sqlite3 fitness-coach.db
SELECT * FROM race_tags;
```
Should show your race tags.

### Test 4: Multiple Devices
1. Tag races on one device
2. Login on another device
3. ‚úÖ Race tags appear on both devices

## üìä Before vs After

| Feature | Before (localStorage) | After (Database) |
|---------|----------------------|------------------|
| Persistence | ‚ùå Lost on reconnect | ‚úÖ Permanent |
| Cross-device | ‚ùå Device-specific | ‚úÖ Synced |
| Browser data | ‚ùå Lost on clear | ‚úÖ Safe |
| Backup | ‚ùå No backup | ‚úÖ In database |
| Multi-user | ‚ùå Shared storage | ‚úÖ Per-user |

---

## üîê Security

- All API endpoints require authentication
- Session token verified on every request
- Race tags are user-specific (can't see others' tags)
- SQL injection protected (prepared statements)
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity

---

## üöÄ Benefits

1. **Permanent Storage** - Never lose race tags again
2. **Cross-Device Sync** - Tags available on all devices
3. **Backup Safe** - Stored in database backups
4. **Multi-User** - Each user has their own tags
5. **Scalable** - Can add more metadata later (race name, goal time, etc.)

---

## üìù Migration Notes

**Existing users with localStorage race tags:**

The old localStorage tags won't automatically migrate. Users will need to retag their races once. After that, tags will persist forever.

**Optional: Add migration script** (future enhancement):
- Read localStorage `race_tags` on first load
- Bulk upload to backend
- Clear localStorage after successful upload

---

## üéâ Result

Race tags now persist permanently in the database! You can:
- ‚úÖ Reconnect Strava without losing tags
- ‚úÖ Clear browser data without losing tags
- ‚úÖ Access tags from multiple devices
- ‚úÖ Never worry about losing race history
