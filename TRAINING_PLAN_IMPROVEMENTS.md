- Blue-themed highlight box to stand out
- Helpful prompts section with 6 suggested topics:
  - Training history & experience level
  - Recent injuries or health concerns
  - Time constraints & schedule preferences
  - Equipment available (trainer, power meter, etc.)
  - Specific weaknesses to address
  - Past performance goals or PRs

**Example Use Cases:**
- "I'm coming back from a knee injury and need to build back gradually..."

### 4. **Theme Support**
All changes implemented with full light and dark theme support:

**Form Fields:**

- `border-input` for borders
- `bg-background` for backgrounds
- `focus:ring-ring` for focus states

**AI Context Box:**
- Light: `bg-blue-50` with `border-blue-200`
- Dark: `bg-blue-950/30` with `border-blue-800`
- Text colors adapt: `text-blue-900 dark:text-blue-100`

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Form Data Structure
```javascript
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  eventName: '',
  eventDate: '',
  startDate: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
  eventType: 'Endurance',
  priority: 'High Priority', // Updated default
  daysPerWeek: 5,
  maxHoursPerWeek: 10,
  preference: 'Both',
  aiContext: '', // NEW FIELD
});
```

### API Integration
The `aiContext` is now passed to the backend in the plan generation request:

```javascript
goals: {
  eventName: formData.eventName,
  eventDate: formData.eventDate,
  eventType: formData.eventType,
  priority: formData.priority,
  duration,
  aiContext: formData.aiContext || undefined, // NEW
}
```

### Components Updated
- **PlanGenerator.jsx**
  - Added `Brain` icon import from lucide-react
  - Added `Textarea` component import
  - Updated all form field classes for theme support
  - Added AI context section with helpful prompts
  - Updated API payload to include `aiContext`

## üé® UI/UX Enhancements

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Form Fields** - Standard input styling
2. **AI Context Box** - Highlighted with blue theme, stands out
3. **Generate Button** - Primary action below context

### Accessibility
- Proper label associations with `htmlFor`
- Semantic HTML structure
- Theme-aware color contrasts
- Clear placeholder text

### Responsive Design
- Grid layout for helpful prompts (1 col mobile, 2 cols desktop)
- Flexible textarea that adapts to content
- Mobile-friendly touch targets

## üöÄ Backend Integration Required

The backend `/api/training/plan/generate` endpoint should be updated to:

1. **Accept `aiContext` field** in `goals` object
2. **Incorporate into AI prompt** when generating plans
3. **Use context to personalize:**
   - Training volume progression
   - Session types and intensity
   - Recovery recommendations
   - Specific adaptations for injuries/constraints

### Example Backend Prompt Enhancement
```javascript
const systemPrompt = `You are an expert cycling coach creating a personalized training plan.

${goals.aiContext ? `
User Context:
${goals.aiContext}

Take this context into account when designing the plan.
` : ''}

Event: ${goals.eventName}
Type: ${goals.eventType}
Priority: ${goals.priority}
...
`;
```

## üìä Priority-Based Plan Variations

Different priorities should influence plan characteristics:

| Priority | Focus | Intensity | Recovery |
|----------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Peak Performance | Race-specific | High | Structured |
| High Priority | Event-focused | Moderate-High | Adequate |
| Moderate Priority | Balanced | Moderate | Generous |
| Maintenance | Consistency | Low-Moderate | Flexible |
| Base Building | Aerobic development | Low | Active |
| Recovery/Comeback | Injury prevention | Very low | Extensive |

## üéØ Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Ideas:
1. **Smart defaults** - Pre-fill aiContext based on priority selection
2. **Character counter** - Show "245 / 1000 characters"
3. **Example prompts** - Quick-fill buttons for common scenarios
4. **Save context** - Store in localStorage for refinement
5. **Conditional validation** - Make event date truly optional for off-season

### Phase 3 Ideas:
1. **AI suggestions** - Analyze user profile and suggest context to add
2. **Template library** - Pre-written contexts for common scenarios
3. **Voice input** - Allow users to speak their context
4. **Context history** - Save and reuse previous contexts

## üìù User Documentation

### How to Use AI Context
"The AI Coach context box allows you to share additional information that helps create a more personalized training plan. Think of it as talking to a real coach - share your history, constraints, goals, and any special considerations. The more context you provide, the better your plan will be tailored to your specific needs."

### When to Use Different Priorities
- **Peak Performance**: Your most important race of the year
- **High Priority**: Important events you want to perform well at
- **Moderate Priority**: Fun events or tune-ups
- **Maintenance**: Just staying fit, no specific performance goal
- **Base Building**: Off-season, building aerobic foundation
- **Recovery/Comeback**: Returning from injury, illness, or time off
